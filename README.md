# A24: What Should I Watch?

### a24-intensive-redesign

A24 is a project that showcases a selection of films and television shows produced by A24 Films. It provides information about these works, including trailers, cast, and other details. This is a redesign of a project I worked on over a year ago and was the first intensive project I did during my time at ACS.
